## Biography

I am a first year graduate student in Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington, 
co-advised by Zaid Harchaoui and Maryam Fazel. My current research interests include reinforcement learning, imitation learning, online optimization, safe statistical machine learning, and applications to robotics.

Before that, I did a master degree at ENS Paris-Saclay in Mathematics Applied to Vision and Learning (MVA) and a master degree at Mines Paristech in Geostatistics and Probabilities. I also studied applications of operators adapted wavelets to image processing with Houman Owhadi during an exchange program with the CMS department of Caltech.

You can find the report of my project at Caltech on my research experiences page and the related code on github. You can also find on github my undergraduate research project comparing the application of a Fourier transform and a Haar wavelet transform to image compression.
